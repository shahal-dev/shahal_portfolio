## Overview

Nuptial-Link is a company that develops software for blockchain-based marriage registration. We believe that blockchain technology can revolutionize the way marriage records are managed, making them more secure, efficient, and transparent. Our software provides a secure and immutable ledger for storing marriage records, which can be accessed by authorized users from anywhere in the world. We also offer a variety of features that make it easy for users to register their marriages, including online registration, e-signatures, and automatic notifications. We are committed to providing our users with the best possible experience, and we are excited to be at the forefront of this new technology.
## Key Features
